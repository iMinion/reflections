Q: What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Well an empty git repository is constructed. It has to be done so that we can initialise the git properties


Q: How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area gives us the chance of choosing the files we want to commit. It is more like a priority box. It will be in the working directory and repository itself. But, as we said earlier it is more like a priority box which enables us to choose which one to commit first.
