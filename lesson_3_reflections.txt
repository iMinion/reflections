When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I work in for a team and when I would like to share the data. Besides when I would like to look back to my code, it is better to have it on a cloud than local device. So we don't loose it

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Automatically, leverages the machine as it does not know if the change is made or not! But doing it manually becomes tricky! So, for every one stage that had been done one has to push it to the git hub cloud

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork - When we want to copy one's work to our repo in GitHub
    clone - When we would like to work on a local system
    branches - When we would like to make any changes to the file but do not want to loose the old data.

stored locally?
